# four-equals-ten-solver

This is a solver for the puzzle game 4=10.

In each puzzle, the game presents you with a number with four digits and the objective is to combine them
into an expression that equals 10.

The solver is a python script that uses just the standard library and a command line interface with a menu.

### Features:
- Get a list of all solutions to a given puzzle
- Find out which operators are used for the different solutions
- Find out which parenthesis placements make up each solution

I made this solver because I thought it was a cool script to program
and also because I got a bit stuck in the last 10 levels or so.

The game offers to show you one solution to a puzzle per day, but I wanted hints instead.
So, on top of computing all solutions to a given puzzle, the solver also computes hints like how many solutions use a
certain operator and how many use a certain parenthesis placement.

This way you can guide yourself and make puzzles a bit easier to manage.
